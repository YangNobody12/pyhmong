## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report:
- Check if the bug has already been reported in the Issues section
- Verify the bug exists in the latest version

When creating a bug report, include:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Python version and operating system
- Code samples if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful
- List any alternative solutions you've considered

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Simple issues for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for your changes
4. Run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

5. Format your code:

```bash
make format
```

6. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add amazing feature"
```

7. Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

8. Open a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all public methods and classes

### Code Formatting

We use **Black** for code formatting:

```bash
black pyhmong tests
```

### Import Ordering

We use **isort** for import ordering:

```bash
isort pyhmong tests
```

### Type Hints

Add type hints to all function signatures:

```python
def tokenize(text: str) -> List[str]:
    """Tokenize Hmong text."""
    pass
```

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Longer description if needed.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When value is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> example_function("test", 42)
        True
    """
    pass
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in classes

### Test Structure

```python
class TestFeatureName(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test cases for FeatureName."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        pass
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic functionality works."""
        pass
    
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test edge cases are handled."""
        pass
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_pyhmong.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_pyhmong.py::TestHmongProcessor::test_tokenize

# Run with coverage
make coverage
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Critical code paths should have 100% coverage
- Check coverage report:

```bash
make coverage
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public classes and methods
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful
- Update documentation when changing functionality

### README Updates

If your change affects:
- Installation process
- API usage
- Features list
- Examples

Please update the README.md accordingly.

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Build HTML documentation
make docs

# View documentation
open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

## Pull Request Process
